see when the qr is scanned we must hit "@https://637b-103-216-234-205.ngrok-free.app /validate_otp" with "Request: 
{
    "party_ids_to_store_ids": "12D3KooWDaySDeoKfitysdGfPdiNYSrLYbH5WzsCim2ZTeorHNPG:9e41b1a7-6d72-4fcd-92c1-5adfcf39f1af",

    "seed": "alicee_2345",
    "otp": 804649
}" and we will get response "Response:
{
    "data": {
        "otp": 804649,
        "isvalid": 1
    }
}" ... this data will be in the ticekt and the seed is username and if we get isvalid as 1 then set validationStaus as valid and show like green thing and this must be done after scanning
