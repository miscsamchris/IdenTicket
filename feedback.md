# Nillion Developer Feedback

## 1.	Rate Your Experience

On a scale of 1 to 5, I would rate the overall developer experience with Nillion as a 3.5

## 2.	Tools and Resources

**What docs did you use while building your project?**
 We used the Docs found in the nillion Dcoumenttion page and we alse used the documentation provided with the code.
**What tools did you use while building your project?**
- We used the following tools in IdenTicket
  * nada
  * nillion-devnet
  * pynadac
  * nada-ai
  * nada-numpy
  * nilup
  * py_nillion_client
  * nillion/client-web
  
-**Any other tools?**
  * Postman

**What additional docs or examples would be helpful for Nillion development?**
  * Clear architectural description of the Nillion network and information on the internal operations performed in nodes would be of great help

**What additional tools would be helpful for Nillion development?**
 An AI Agent for referening the docs would be really helpful, Alng with a custom trained LLM for generating Nada programs. This would be a killer feature.
 
## 3.	Encountered Errors

## 4. Support and Resources

**What was most helpful when you faced issues during development with Nillion?**
- Nillion Office Hours
  * Jose, Mathias, Tim connected with us over a call to provide their feedback on our usecase. It was great talking to them about future possibilities of our usecases
- Direct assistance from the Nillion team over Discord
  * Thanks to Dave, Jose and Steph for clearing any blockers we had during development phase
- Nillion documentation

## 5. Suggestions for Improvement

<h3>Technical Insights</h3>
<ul>
<li>The current support for NADA is limited in Nillion and needs to be extended with multiple other arithmetic operations and libraries to support more complex computations. In order to create higher grade cryptographic algorithms, we would need multi-operand computation in a single line for much cleaner code. We had to create multiple temporary variables, making the code a bit clumsy.</li>
<li>We observed some intermittent connection issues connecting to Nillion Testnet.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li>The concept of blind app is a new technology of its kind and the perfect feature for the IdenTicket Platform. We were able to securely execute our cryptographic computations on the Nillion Network and generate the TOTP.</li>
<li>We used nada-ai and nada-numpy to create a neural network that figures out the travel time estimation feature on IdenTicket The secure execution environment of Nillion provides the privacy required to preserve user data.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Improvement Suggestions</h3>
<ul>
<li>It would be great to have Nada Libraries for Hashing Algorithms.</li>
<li>We are really looking forward to the time when other types of Secrets are fully fleshed out i.e  SecretBlob</li>
<li>We also need support for logic operations like AND, OR, and NOT operations on the operands.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Success Stories</h3>
<p>Our project leverages the Blind app created on Nillion to verify the Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTPs) generated by the client application. This integration of Nillion's Blind app technology provides the ideal secure authentication mechanism needed for our IDENTICKET system, enhancing both the security and privacy aspects of our ticketing solution.</p>
